# ToneRowFiddle

Sometimes I dabble in 12-tone composition. This is a public version of a tool I made for myself. 

# What does this tool do?

It creates 12-tone matrices from 12-tone rows. (Actually the algorithm is generic so you can make N-tone matrices, even from tonal themes). 

You can input "tone fragments" and the tool highlights which rows are compatible with that fragment.

You can find prime forms of pitch class sets.
